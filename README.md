Beat Saber mod to revert the dot note hitboxes in 1.20+ to their former glory

You can choose to enable old dot note hitboxes on any map, at the cost of score submission.

This mod optionally adds a "warning icon" to maps containing dot notes.
 - This warning icon replaces the note count icon with a dot note, colored according to your setting and whether or not old dot note hitboxes are enabled. 
  - It also lists the number of dot notes in the map next to the total note count.

This mod also optionally creates a new "version" of difficulties containing dot notes under a new characteristic. This allows you to both play with old dot note hitboxes and submit scores, but under a separate leaderboard.
